## Problem
We have a list that gets so many insertions and deletions at a small amount of time
to obtain good preformance for our software we use a fine tuned data sturcture with a combination of algorithms to get the best performance when sorting, inserting, removing, finding items in the list.

## Contents
- index.js: where you should add your implementation.
- index.test.js: you should start by adding unit tests to cover the rest of the required methods.
- index.naive.js: that file contains a naive poorly performing implmentation you can look at and optimize.

## Don't forget, run the tests and the banchmark using:
- `npm run test`
- `npm run benchmark`
